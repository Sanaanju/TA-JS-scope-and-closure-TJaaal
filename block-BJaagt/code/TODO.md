Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.

Example:

function hello() {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(username); // output
In above code we are looking for the variable named usename. There is no variable named username in the global scope. The variable is inside the function named hello and we can't access the variable defined inside a function from outside.

The above code will throw an error Reference Error username is not defined.

Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.
{
  const username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(username); // username is not defined
In above code we are looking for the variable named usename. There is no variable named username in the global scope. The variable is inside the object and we can't access the variable defined inside a object from outside.

The above code will throw an error Reference Error username is not defined.

Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.
if (true) {
  let username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(username); // username is not defined
In above code we are looking for the variable named usename. There is no variable named username in the global scope. The variable is inside the object and we can't access the variable defined inside a object from outside.

The above code will throw an error Reference Error username is not defined.

Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.
if (true) {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(username); // Arya
In above code we are looking for the variable named usename. There is no variable named username in the global scope. The variable is inside the object and and it is defined with var and var is only function scope not object scope so it has access from out side of object

The above code will return Arya.

Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.
let username = 'John';
if (true) {
  var username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(username); // username is already decleared
In above code we have defined variable name username using let and var is not object scope so inside object we can not create variable of same name which is already defined using let and const.

code will return syntaxError: Identifier 'username' has already been decleared

Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.
let username = 'John';
if (true) {
  let username = 'Arya';
}
console.log(username); // John
In above code we have defined variable name username using let and also defined username inside object. let is object scope so inside object we can create variable of same name which is already defined using let and const.

code will return john.

Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.
let username = 'John';
function sayHello() {
  let username = 'Arya';
}
sayHello();
console.log(username); // John
In above code username is defined using let in global scope and in function. let is object and function scope so we can define variable which is already defined in global scope. but console log will show username of global scope because username inside function will not have access from out side

code will return john

Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.
for (var i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i, 'First'); // 9
}
console.log(i, 'Second'); // 10
In above code i is defined using var in object so console log inside object will return i value from 0 to 9. and console log out side object will take last i inside object and add one in that i because there is i++ and it will return 10.

Go through the code below and write down the process of making decision about looking for the variable. Also write the output of the code below.
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i, 'First'); // 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9
}
console.log(i, 'Second'); // `referenceError: i is not defined.`
In above code i is defined in side object so first console log will show all i value from 0 to 9. and console log out side object will not access i so it will return referenceError: i is not defined.
